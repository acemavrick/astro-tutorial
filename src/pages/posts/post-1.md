# first post
This is supposed to be my first post.
Instead of me writing it, I will let an AI write it.

```txt
Write a short blog post about something in the style of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream".
```

Here we go.


# *And Still, the Laundry Waits*

It is always the same basket.  
White plastic, handles cracked from years of carrying the same weight—  
shirts, socks, a towel that has somehow been “almost dry” for three days.  

The basket does not move.  
It waits.  
It *knows*.  

---

I fold one shirt.  
The pile beside me grows taller,  
but the basket is never empty—  
it swallows each victory and replaces it with another sleeve, another sock  
that demands reunion with its twin.  

Time has no meaning here.  
The clock is measured in lint.

---

There is no **“Finished”** in this place.  
There never has been.  
The dryer door closes with the same finality as a prison cell,  
only to open again,  
spitting out heat and static like some petty weather system.  

I try to rebel—  
wearing the same hoodie for days,  
pretending the laundry does not exist.  
But it waits.  
It *always* waits.

---

I dream in fabric.  
A kaleidoscope of cotton and polyester,  
endless mountains of towels,  
bedsheets that stretch to the horizon.  

Somewhere deep in the folds,  
I find the scrap of paper I left in my jeans pocket weeks ago.  
It reads:  

> *I would scream, but the only sound here is the slow, wet thud of clothes tumbling.*

I cannot tell if I am doing the laundry…  
or if the laundry is doing me.
